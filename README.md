**Project Description: Audio Signal Analysis and Phoneme Exploration**

**Overview**

This project delves into two fascinating aspects of audio signal processing: DTMF frequency encoding and phoneme analysis. By combining theory, code, and practical exercises, we explore the following:

**1. DTMF Frequency Encoding:**

* Understand how Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals encode information.
* Generate sine waves with specific sampling rates.
* Visualize signals in both time and frequency domains.
* Implement DTMF signal coding and decoding.

**2. Phoneme Exploration:**

* Investigate the acoustic properties of phonemes (distinct speech sounds).
* Utilize provided functions to organize and visualize phoneme data.
* Analyze a small dataset to identify key features (F1, F2, F3) and pitch.
* Record and analyze your own voice samples to deepen understanding.

**Project Structure**
**1. DTMF Encoding and Decoding:**

* Code samples for generating DTMF signals.
* Visualization of time-domain and frequency-domain representations.
* Implementation of DTMF decoding algorithms.

**2. Phoneme Analysis:**

* Functions to organize and visualize phoneme data.
* Step-by-step analysis of provided dataset. 
* Instructions for recording and analyzing personal voice samples.

**Goals:**

* Gain practical insights into audio signal processing techniques.
* Understand the role of frequency components in DTMF encoding.
* Explore the acoustic characteristics of phonemes.
* Apply knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the provided functions, and enhance your understanding of audio signals and phonetics!
